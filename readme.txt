Wiki Embed lets you embed mediawiki pages in to your site, sites like Wikipedia

== Description ==

The Wiki Embed's intent is to help create a (http://wiki.ubc.ca/Resource_Management_Framework "Resourse Management Framework").

It tries its damn hardest to pull in the content from a mediawiki page into the wordpress environment. After html scraping the content from the mediawiki page using a special url. ( note: try adding '?action=render' to the end of to any mediawiki url) it strips out unwanted content and adds some tabs if you so desire.
